# Study and modeling of dynamical properties in the conservative gene regulatory networks in animal development
This repository contains the main code, data, and figures of the project. All code is written in Mathematica. 
## Description of files in this repository

The main folders have files of the main methodological procedures and results got in `mainText`. Each one of these folders contain the scripts for simulations `~/scripts/`, the output files for some of the scripts `~/outData/`, and the output figures for some data `~/outFigures/`. 

- `1uniNoiseExpression/` contains the files for simulation of regulatory systems in one cell usign the Next Generation Method (NGM or GA).
- `2uniNoisePropReg/` contains the files for simulation of noise propagation from regulator to regulated gene using NGM.
- `3multiMethodEvaluation/` contains the files for  simulation of self-regulated gene using the Chemical Master Equation (CME).
- `4multiNoiseCommunityE/` contains the files for simulation of self-regulated gene in a cell colony using CME.

The first and the second folder correspond to section 4 of `mainText`. The third corresponds to section 3 and the last one to section 5.
